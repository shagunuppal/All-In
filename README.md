# All-In

This repository contains code for the detection of the current state (no. of faceup cards along with their suit and rank) of a poker game using different concepts of Digital Image Processing such as Hough Transform, Contour Extraction, and Template Matching, and suggesting further moves to the player.

The project was done as a part of the Digital Image Processing course at IIIT-Delhi.
